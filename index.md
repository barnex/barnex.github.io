## just-in-time-compiler

[https://github.com/barnex/just-in-time-compiler] is a just-in-time compiler for mathematical expressions like `x + sqrt(y - 1)`. It compiles to x86 machine code wich can be immediately executed for, e.g., super-fast function plotting.

## ev3cam

[ev3cam](http://github.com/barnex/ev3cam) detects motion in a webcam stream, so that a LEGO mindstorms knows where to aim :-).
